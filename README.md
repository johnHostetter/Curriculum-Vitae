## About Me üôÇ
I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate with experience implementing neural architectures called neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs).
I will defend my dissertation and graduate in the Spring of 2025. and am looking for a new opportunity to continue building eXplainable AI!

## Current Work üî≠

I am researching a new prototype NFN that can automatically reconfigure its knowledge base in response to its performance with respect to an objective function.
These architectures natively handle missing data in the inputs and can easily transfer their knowledge to other models. The results of this novel work will be reported in my dissertation.

## Primary Accomplishments üèÜ

- Invented the first method to achieve fuzzy reinforcement learning in computer vision tasks (pending review).
- First publication to create NFNs for tasks with high-dimensions (to the best of my knowledge).

- Published the first work solely dedicated to offline fuzzy reinforcement learning.

- First work to use fuzzy logic control to yield a pedagogical policy.

## Fun Fact ‚ö°

My "coding buddy" is an adopted three year old Siberian Husky named Zoey!
