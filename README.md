I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate with experience implementing neural architectures called neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs).
I will defend my dissertation and graduate in the Spring of 2025. and am looking for a new opportunity to continue building eXplainable AI!

## Current Work üî≠

I am researching a new prototype NFN that can automatically reconfigure its knowledge base in response to its performance with respect to an objective function.
This novel method will be reported in my dissertation.

## Primary Accomplishments üèÜ

- Published the first work solely dedicated to offline fuzzy reinforcement learning.

- First publication to create NFNs for tasks with high-dimensions (to the best of my knowledge).

- First work to use fuzzy logic control to yield a pedagogical policy.

- Invented the first method to achieve fuzzy reinforcement learning in computer vision tasks (pending review).
